name: lean-review
description: Review a branch or PR's diff against main and report opportunities to subtract — simplify, delete, and reduce the number of concepts a reader has to hold in their head. Use when users want to (1) review a branch before merge for bloat, (2) find dead code or premature abstractions, (3) identify duplication of existing utilities, (4) audit AI-generated code for over-engineering, or (5) reduce LOC without changing behavior. Report-only by default; only applies fixes when the user explicitly says so.

# /lean-review — Subtract over add

Review the current branch's diff against a base branch (default `main`) and
report opportunities to simplify, delete, or consolidate. The goal is to lower
the number of concepts a reader has to hold in their head, not just to shrink
LOC. AI-generated code tends toward additive: extra layers, validation that
can't fire, helper functions used once, comments restating the code. This skill
forces a "what can come out?" pass before merge.

This skill is **report-only by default**. After the report is produced, the
user may say "apply #2, #5, #7" or "fix the cosmetic ones" and the skill will
apply only those specific findings, never the consensus-critical ones without
explicit per-finding confirmation.

## Quick start

```bash
# Review current branch vs main
.claude/skills/lean-review/scripts/collect-diff.sh

# Review vs a different base
.claude/skills/lean-review/scripts/collect-diff.sh devnet-4
```

Then walk the changed files and produce the structured report below.

## Workflow

### 1. Collect the diff

Run `scripts/collect-diff.sh [base]` to get a structured overview of what
changed: files, line counts per file, new files, biggest additions, total LOC
delta. This bounds the scope — review **only what this branch added**, not
the whole repo. If you start suggesting changes to code that already existed
on the base branch, you're out of scope.

### 2. Filter out don't-touch paths

Drop any file matching `references/dont-touch.md` before analysis. The most
common ones: `*_encoding.go` (generated), `xmss/rust/` (different review
process), `internal/specfixtures/*.go` (mirrors JSON shape), spec-mirroring function
bodies in `internal/statetransition/` (structure must match leanSpec for
auditability). If the entire diff is don't-touch, say so and stop.

### 3. Read each remaining file and classify additions

For each addition (a new function, a new branch, a new helper, a new struct
field), classify it into one of the six categories from
`references/finding-categories.md`:

| Category | What it looks like |
|---|---|
| `dead-code` | Unused function/method, unreachable branch, variable written never read, exported symbol no caller imports |
| `premature-abstraction` | Helper called exactly once, interface with one implementor, generic that has only one instantiation, wrapper that adds no behavior |
| `defensive-bloat` | Validation at an internal boundary already guaranteed by the caller, nil-check on a value the type system says can't be nil, error path that can't be reached |
| `duplicates-existing-util` | New code that could call a function already in this package (or `internal/types/`, `internal/storage/`, `logger/`, etc.) |
| `comment-bloat` | Comments that restate the code, "added for X" / "used by Y" rot, stale TODOs, multi-line docstrings on obvious functions |
| `over-validated-boundary` | Treating an internal caller's input as if it were external user input |

For each finding, before reporting it, you MUST:

- **Grep the package** (and `internal/types/`, `internal/storage/`, `logger/`) for utilities
  that already do what the new code does. The single highest-value finding
  type is "this could reuse `X` in `path/file.go:LINE`" — humans miss these
  most often.
- **Note test coverage**. Run `grep -l <symbol>` in the relevant test
  directory. A finding backed by "removed code, all callers covered by
  tests" is much stronger than pure static reasoning.

### 4. Assess risk class per finding

| Risk class | Definition | What's allowed |
|---|---|---|
| `cosmetic` | Comments, naming, formatting, log strings. Cannot affect runtime behavior. | Auto-apply when user requests `--fix`. |
| `structural` | Code refactor; behavior must be preserved, tests must re-pass. Examples: inlining a one-use helper, deleting an unused field, collapsing two branches. | Apply on explicit per-finding approval. Re-run tests after each apply. |
| `consensus-critical` | Anything in `internal/statetransition/`, `internal/forkchoice/`, `internal/node/` (engine, store, fork choice integration), `internal/types/` (non-encoding), `internal/p2p/host.go`, `internal/p2p/reqresp.go`, or the XMSS Go binding. | **Report only.** Never apply without explicit per-finding human review, even on `--fix`. |

When in doubt, escalate the risk class. A wrong "structural" call on
consensus code is much worse than a verbose report.

### 5. Cross-reference spec compliance

For findings inside `internal/statetransition/` or `internal/types/`, check whether the
"redundant" code mirrors a named leanSpec function. Code that looks
duplicated may be intentionally mirroring two separate spec functions to
preserve auditability. See `.claude/skills/spec-compliant/references/spec-gean-mapping.md`
for the mapping. If a finding would diverge gean from spec structure, tag it
`spec-divergence-risk` and downgrade to report-only regardless of category.

### 6. Generate the report

Output in this structure. One section per category, findings sorted by LOC
saved descending within each category. End with the summary table.

```markdown
## /lean-review report — <branch> vs <base>

**Scope:** N files changed (+A / -B LOC), M files reviewed after don't-touch filter

### dead-code

#### #1 — `internal/syncer/sync.go:142-168` (−27 LOC) — `structural`
**Finding:** `markStaleRoots` is exported but only called inside the package,
and its only caller `pruneStaleRoots` was deleted in commit abc1234. No
external imports.

**Suggested change:** Delete `markStaleRoots` and its test
`TestMarkStaleRoots`.

**Why safe:** No callers outside the file. `go vet ./...` and
`make test` should pass unchanged.

**Test coverage:** `internal/syncer/sync_test.go:88` (TestMarkStaleRoots) — also delete.

---

#### #2 — `internal/p2p/peers.go:55-58` (−4 LOC) — `cosmetic`
**Finding:** Unreachable branch — `if peer == nil` after `peer, ok :=
m[id]; !ok { return }` two lines above.

**Suggested change:** Delete the nil-check block.

**Why safe:** Control flow guarantees `peer != nil` at this point.

**Test coverage:** N/A (dead branch).

---

### premature-abstraction

#### #3 — `internal/node/validator.go:204-218` (−15 LOC) — `consensus-critical`
**Finding:** `wrapAttestationSigner` is a 14-line wrapper around
`keys.SignAttestation` with a single call site at `validator.go:312`. Adds
no behavior.

**Suggested change:** Inline the call. See report-only note below.

**Why safe (proposed):** Wrapper is pure passthrough; inlining is a
behavior-preserving refactor.

**Test coverage:** `internal/node/validator_test.go:177` covers the call site.

> **Report-only.** Consensus-critical path. Even though the refactor is
> mechanical, the wrapper may exist to mark a future signature-policy
> insertion point. Human must confirm intent before inlining.

---

### duplicates-existing-util

#### #4 — `internal/node/block.go:88-104` (−14 LOC) — `structural`
**Finding:** New helper `bytesToHex` duplicates
`internal/types/util.go:42 BytesToHex`, same signature, same body.

**Suggested change:** Delete the local helper, import + call
`types.BytesToHex`.

**Why safe:** Identical implementation; same test coverage flows through.

**Test coverage:** `internal/types/util_test.go:60` covers BytesToHex.

---

### defensive-bloat

(no findings)

### comment-bloat

#### #5 — `internal/storage/pebble.go:201-209` (−8 LOC) — `cosmetic`
**Finding:** 8-line comment explaining what `Get` does, when the function
signature `Get(table Table, key []byte) ([]byte, error)` is
self-documenting. Comment also includes "added for issue #142" which is PR
context, not code context.

**Suggested change:** Delete the comment.

**Why safe:** Pure comment removal, no runtime effect.

---

### over-validated-boundary

(no findings)

### Summary

| Category | Cosmetic | Structural | Consensus-critical | LOC saved |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| dead-code | 1 | 1 | 0 | 31 |
| premature-abstraction | 0 | 0 | 1 | 15 |
| duplicates-existing-util | 0 | 1 | 0 | 14 |
| defensive-bloat | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| comment-bloat | 1 | 0 | 0 | 8 |
| over-validated-boundary | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Total** | **2** | **2** | **1** | **68** |

**Top concepts removed:** one helper duplicating an existing utility, one
exported-but-unused function, one wrapper around a single call.

**Next step:** Reply with finding IDs to apply (e.g. "apply #1 #2 #4 #5") or
"apply all cosmetic" / "apply all structural". Consensus-critical findings
(#3) require explicit per-finding approval and will not be auto-applied.
```

## Fix mode

When the user replies with `apply #N` or similar after the report:

1. Apply only the requested findings, in order.
2. For each finding, run the smallest test scope that covers it
   (`go test ./<package>/`). For consensus-critical findings, also run
   `make test`. For findings in `internal/types/`, also run `make sszgen` first if a
   struct changed, then `make test`.
3. Commit each applied finding as its own commit with the finding ID and a
   one-line summary, so each is trivially revertible:
   `git commit -m "lean-review #4: inline bytesToHex into types.BytesToHex"`
4. If any test fails: stop, revert the last commit, report which finding
   caused the failure, do not continue to the next finding.
5. Refuse `apply #N` for any consensus-critical finding unless the user
   also says "I've reviewed this" or equivalent. Print the finding and ask
   for explicit confirmation.

## What this skill does NOT do

- **Does not propose adding code.** If the right fix is "this needs a new
  helper," that's outside scope — flag it as a comment in the report but
  don't suggest the addition.
- **Does not reformat or restyle.** `gofmt` and `golint` handle that.
- **Does not enforce coding standards.** It looks for subtraction
  opportunities, not style violations.
- **Does not benchmark.** Performance suggestions belong in a different
  review pass.
- **Does not touch files outside the diff.** Even if you spot something on
  the base branch that's bloated, it's out of scope for this branch's
  review.
