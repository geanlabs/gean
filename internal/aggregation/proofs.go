// maxChildProofsPerGroup bounds how many child proofs one group may fold in.
// A child is a recursive input: measured on a 16-core host, a group carrying one
// costs 1.68-2.96s against 0.31-0.91s for raw signatures alone, with no overlap
// between the ranges. The cap bounds the worst case a single group can spend
// once raw-first selection has already removed most recursion.
const maxChildProofsPerGroup = 2

// selectChildProofs folds coverage-adding child proofs into the aggregation
// inputs. covered may be seeded with raw signers. The returned participant IDs
// identify raw inputs that must be removed to avoid raw/child double inclusion.
//
// The cap counts children already in the slice, so it holds across the separate
// new-payload and known-payload passes that share one group's inputs.
//
// childCost is the wall time one child is expected to add, charged against the
// window still left in the session; rawCount is how many raw signatures the
// group already holds. Two children are exempt from that charge, for two
// different reasons:
//
//   - Until rawCount+children reaches two the group is not yet spec-viable, so
//     charging for those children could leave it unable to produce anything.
//   - The first child is admitted regardless. Validators reachable only through
//     a child proof have no raw signature to fall back on, and pricing that
//     first child out under a tight budget defers exactly the votes finality is
//     waiting on, every session, for as long as the pressure lasts.
//
// Every child after that must fit the remaining budget.
//
// Selection is greedy on coverage: each round takes the proof adding the most
// still-uncovered validators, matching leanSpec's select_proofs_for_coverage.
// Walking the pool in stored order instead can take several low-coverage proofs
// where one wide proof would do, and every extra child is a recursive input the
// prover pays for.
